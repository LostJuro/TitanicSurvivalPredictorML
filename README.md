# Titanic Survival Predictor

A machine learning project that predicts the chances of survival for passengers on the Titanic using logistic regression. The model analyzes features such as age, sex, passenger class, and other attributes to classify whether a passenger would survive.

## Features

- Predict survival of passengers on the Titanic dataset.
- Implements logistic regression with Python and scikit-learn.
- Evaluates model performance with accuracy and a confusion matrix.
- Easy to extend with additional features or models.

## How It Works

The project uses a **supervised learning** approach:

1. **Data Preprocessing** – Clean the dataset, handle missing values, encode categorical variables.  
2. **Model Training** – Train a logistic regression model on the training set.  
3. **Evaluation** – Test the model and calculate metrics such as accuracy and confusion matrix.  
4. **Prediction** – Predict survival for new passenger data.
